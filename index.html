			        	<h4>Welcome</h4>
			        	<p>Hi I'm Lindsay, I am a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Guelph. On top of that I am working towards a minor in Mathematics. Along with my studies I am a Teaching Assistant for my school's first year programming class. I am currently on the search for my 4th co-op placement out of a total of 5. </p>
			        	<p>Incase you were wondering what the <b>Jomar</b> and <b>Freshbooks</b> tabs meant, those are my past two work terms. In their own different ways, they have been a big part in creating the programmer I am today. If anyone from either of those places are reading this, I miss you guys and thanks for putting up with me everyday.</p>
			        	<p>Life away from the computer includes yoga, reading, hiking, and adventure. I like to think I have an optimitic and enthusiatic personality paired with a terrible sense of humor.</p>
			        	<p>The purpose of this website is to share my experience with others. Enjoy.</p>

<!-- JOMAR -->
			        <div id='Jomar' class='tabcontent'>
			        	<div style="float:center; padding:20px 0px ; width:100%">
			        		<img src="photos/logo.png" style="float:center; padding:5px 10px ; width:30%">
			        	</div>
			        	<img src="photos/jomar.png" style="float:right; padding:20px 15px; border-radius: 60px 15px;">
			        	<h4>About Jomar</h4>
			        	<p>My 1st and 2nd work terms were at Jomar Softcorp Internationl in Cambridge, Ontario as a Junior Programmer. Jomar Softcorp Internation is a company that programs software solutions for many different platforms such as utilities, warehouse inventory, insurance, and police services. My placement was at the Head Office in Cambridge Ontario, however they have 2 additional offices in Vacouver, British Columbia and Charolette, North Carolina. </p>

			        	<h4>8 Months as a Junior Programmer</h4>
			        	<p>My work was based on modifications and additions made to the many number of applications created at Jomar. These modifications could take hours, days, or sometimes weeks. I would be involved in the entire process of that modicfication including the initial review, the implementation, and the testing.</p>
			        	<!-- TODO photos should be in seperate folders  -->
						<img src="photos/utilities.png" style="float:left; padding:5px 10px ; width:50%">
						<p>The majority of my work was on the Utilities system, which was great in many ways. The first obviously getting to know how utility meters and how that whole system operates. Another good thing was getting comfortable with the code and database of 1 system so that I could go learn more complex things about that system instead of only touching the surface on many systems. The third good reason that I like to consider myself a Utility Meter specialist is that you work with the same people for 40 hours a weeks so you get to know them better, and they also hold you to a higher standard and give you more responsibility. As a co op student we know we are at the bottom, but it is our job to try our hardest to not finish with the feeling that we are still on the bottom. </p>
						<p>Worked with: SQL, XML, XSL, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Shell Scripts, Batch Files, Database Utilities and Reports</p>

			        	<h4>Goals</h4>
			        	<h5>Did you have any goals for this work term?</h5>
			        	<p>Most of my goals for this work term were based upon social, professional, and personal development.</p>
						<p>When I compare the goals I set for the first and second half of my work term they are very different. The main concern of my first work term was fitting in, learning the ways of the office, trying to keep up. The goals I set for the second half of my workterm were based around improving my workplace and enhancing my environment. I guess what I mean by that is helping the new co ops with simple things so that the people that trained me didn't have to repeat themselves so much. </p>

			        	<h5>Did you develop any goals relating to your job tasks?</h5>
			        	<p>Goals relating to my job taks included things like bring more independent, taking initiative, helping the new co op students that came at my 4 month mark, andlearning more about the company and not just the code.</p>

			        	<h5>What skills did you want to learn?</h5>
			        	<p>When it came to learning new skills I new that I was going to get a lot more familiar with code no matter what, but learning how each piece of the puzzle fit together was something I was really interested in being apart of. One of the main differences between the Computer Science and Software Engineering prograns.</p>

			        	<h5>What technologies did you want to work with and why?</h5>
			        	<p>Databases are everywhere, the more you know about them the better because I know they will follow me everywhere I go. Before working at Jomar I only knew the bare minimum when it came to databases. After completing an 8 month work term I can confidently say I am very comfortable working with databases and what they have to offer. </p>
